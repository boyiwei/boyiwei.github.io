I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu), advised by Prof. [Peter Henderson](https://peterhenderson.co). Before coming to Princeton, I completed my undergraduate degree in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

I am broadly interested in AI alignment and other AI safety-related topics. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating on research or discussing these topics.
